# Student Performance Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project applies a linear regression model to predict final student grades (G3) based on features such as previous grades, study time, failures, and absences. It aims to provide insights into how these factors impact academic performance and demonstrate the application of machine learning in educational analytics.

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate a student's final grade (G3) based on various factors including study time, previous grades (G1, G2), number of failures, and absences. The model was built using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn library, and various data visualization techniques were employed to analyze the results.

This project is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. I also highlight the importance of interpreting model outputs through visualizations such as scatter plots, residual plots, and correlation heatmaps.

## Features
- Linear regression model for predicting student final grades (G3).
- Data preprocessing, including feature selection and train-test split.
- Performance evaluation with accuracy score and residual analysis.
- Visualizations to understand feature importance and model performance:
  - Scatter plot of actual vs predicted values.
  - Residual plot for model accuracy analysis.
  - Correlation heatmap for feature analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's **Student Performance Data Set**. It contains student achievement records from a secondary school, with features like:
- **G1**: First period grade.
- **G2**: Second period grade.
- **G3**: Final grade (target variable).
- **studytime**: Weekly study time.
- **failures**: Number of past class failures.
- **absences**: Number of school absences.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data handling and preprocessing.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For building the linear regression model.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing results.
