# StudentPerformancePredictor
A linear regression model that predicts student final grades (G3) based on factors like previous grades, study time, failures, and absences. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualizations to analyze performance.
This project applies a linear regression model to predict final student grades (G3) based on features such as previous grades, study time, failures, and absences. It aims to provide insights into how these factors impact academic performance and demonstrate the application of machine learning in educational analytics.

Project Overview
In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate a student's final grade (G3) based on various factors including study time, previous grades (G1, G2), number of failures, and absences. The model was built using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn library, and various data visualization techniques were employed to analyze the results.

This project is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. I also highlight the importance of interpreting model outputs through visualizations such as scatter plots, residual plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Features
Linear regression model for predicting student final grades (G3).
Data preprocessing, including feature selection and train-test split.
Performance evaluation with accuracy score and residual analysis.
Visualizations to understand feature importance and model performance:
Scatter plot of actual vs predicted values
Residual plot for model accuracy analysis
Correlation heatmap for feature analysis
Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Student Performance Data Set. It contains student achievement records from a secondary school, with features like:

G1: First period grade
G2: Second period grade
G3: Final grade (target variable)
studytime: Weekly study time
failures: Number of past class failures
absences: Number of school absences
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For building the linear regression model.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing results.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudentPerformancePredictor.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main script to train the model and generate predictions:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Visualizations will be displayed automatically to analyze the model's performance.
Results & Visualizations
The model achieved an accuracy score of 64% on the test data (can be improved based on further tuning).
Key visualizations include:
Actual vs Predicted Values: A scatter plot showing how close the predicted grades are to the actual grades.
Residual Plot: To assess the errors and how well the model fits.
Feature Importance Bar Chart: Visualizing the influence of each feature on the final grade.
Correlation Heatmap: Analyzing relationships between features and the target.
Future Improvements
Improve model accuracy by experimenting with other regression algorithms or adding more advanced techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression.
Perform additional feature engineering to explore more data attributes.
Apply cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
